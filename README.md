### 🛠️ Tech I’m Working With

- Frontend: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `React`
- Backend (learning): `Node.js`, `Express`, `APIs`
- Tools: `Git`, `GitHub`, `VS Code`, `Postman`, `Figma`

### 🚀 Projects

- [**SOMA**](https://github.com/Grt-404/Soma)  
  Lunar surface analysis using OpenCV. A smart detection system for Moon boulders and landslides — my first deep dive into applied tech.

- [**Currency Converter**](https://github.com/Grt-404/Currency-converter)  
  Simple, sharp UI built with HTML/CSS/JS. Uses a live exchange rate API and clean UI elements — responsive and minimal.

### 🌱 Currently

- Learning React deeply — hooks, routing, component architecture  
- Exploring backend development with Node.js  
- Understanding real-world REST APIs and full-stack design  
- Working on new ideas to deploy end-to-end

---

### 📌 What Drives Me

I like building projects that **actually work** — things I can show, deploy, and improve. I prefer **learning by doing**, even if I break things along the way.  
Every project teaches me something new, and that’s the fun of it.

---

### 🧩 Things I’m Exploring Next

- Full-stack project deployment (Render, Netlify, GitHub Pages)  
- Portfolio website with React  
- Real-time apps with WebSocket or Firebase  
- Basic devOps & hosting
