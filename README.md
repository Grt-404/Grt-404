### 🛠️ Tech I’m Working With

- Backend (learning): `Node.js`, `Express`, `APIs`
- Tools: `Git`, `GitHub`, `VS Code`, `Postman`, `Figma`

### 🚀 Projects

- [**Currency Converter**](https://github.com/Grt-404/Currency-converter)  
  A clean and minimal currency converter built using pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It fetches live exchange rates through a public API and focuses on responsive UI and smooth UX.

- [**SOMA**](https://github.com/Grt-404/Soma)  
  An ML-powered Moon surface analysis tool. It detects boulders and landslides from satellite imagery using OpenCV — aimed at improving lunar navigation and landing risk analysis.

### 🌱 Currently

- Learning React and building frontend components  
- Exploring backend with Node.js + Express  
- Practicing **DSA side by side** using Python/C++  
- Improving API integration skills

### 📌 What Drives Me

I like building projects that **actually work** — things I can show, deploy, and improve. I prefer **learning by doing**, even if I break things along the way.  
Every project teaches me something new, and that’s the fun of it.

---

### 🧩 Things I’ll Explore Next

- Deploying real-world projects when they’re ready  
- React-based portfolio site  
- Possibly exploring Firebase or other real-time features
